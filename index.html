                    <li>Bear hugs predate teddy bears by 60 years. The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.</li>

                    <li> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs.</li>
                    <li> They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.   </li>
                    <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools. </li>
